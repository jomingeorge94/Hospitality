# Hospitality - University Project for Android users

Providing the end user with the full services that NHS provides with their patient. 
This involves in giving the ability for the patient to find a service that is close by to them (e.g. finding nearest eye 
clinic in a radius of 5 miles from a given postcode). In addition, within the android application, there should be a functionality
that provides the end user with their individual appointments and have the ability to set remainders for their self (e.g. pick-up 
prescription from a surgery). 

If you need any help with this project, please drop me an email (jomink@yahoo.co.uk).
